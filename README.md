# SICSS-Howard/Mathematica 2022

- Saturday June 18 from 2:30-5:30PM EST on Zoom
- Sunday June 19 from 2:00-5:00PM EST on Zoom

Author and instructor: [Evan Muzzall, Stanford University](https://library.stanford.edu/people/muzzall) muzzall {at} stanford {dot} edu

Assistant: [Jose Aveldanes, UC Berkeley](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/jose-aveldanes)

These are the R workshop materials for [SICSS-HOWARD/Mathematica Summer Institute in Computational Social Science 2022](https://sicss.io/2021/howard-mathematica/) at [Howard University](https://howard.edu/). 

They are inspired by and borrow from [Jae Yeon Kim's]() version from [2021](https://github.com/jaeyk/sicss-howard-r-boot-camp). 

# Workshop goals

This workshop will introduce you to a variety of computational methods in R that can be applied to your own research and give you the confidence to approach old and new projects as an independent learner. Each section will build on the previous one in some way, so be sure to start thinking about the connections in a way that makes sense to you! Also, try to keep a list of questions of things that do not make sense. 

If you are a beginner, you will learn how the computational aspect fits into a basic social science research workflow using the R programming language and RStudio programming environment. 

If you are already an R user this will be a good opportunity to refresh and structure your existing knowledge, while building confidence with the tidyverse to accomplish more complex tasks in easier ways. I encourage you to contribute your perspectives to the topics being covered, strengths and weaknesses, potential pitfalls, and more efficient ways of doing things. 

There are many more topics we cannot get to due to time constraints, such as accessing the American Community Survey through the `tidycensus` package, webscraping, text analysis, machine learning, and more! Contact me if you want to talk more. 

## Datasets

We will use data from the [The Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/), the [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/), the Midwest demographics dataset, and numerous other toy examples throughout to keep you thinking on your feet.

# Setup - R and RStudio Installations

Install both R and RStudio. While they are often referred to synonymously, they are actually two different things: 

- R is the programming language we will use to give instructions to our computer to perform data-related tasks. 
- RStudio is the environment that we will program R in. 

## R

- [Mac users click here to install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/R-4.2.0.pkg)
- [Windows users click here to install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.0-win.exe)

## RStudio

- [Mac and Windows users click here to install RStudio. Click the blue button that says "Recommended for your system:"](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

## Binder

Please try and install R and RStudio before the workshop start time. If you cannot, simply click the Binder button below to launch a version of these workshop materials in RStudio in your preferred web browser. This will take a few minutes to load, so be sure to do so before the workshop start time. 

Click this button [[![Binder]https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EastBayEv/sicss-howard-mathematica-R-2022/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio]](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EastBayEv/sicss-howard-mathematica-R-2022/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio) to launch Binder.
